# JupyterLab in the Browser

This is JupyterLab deployed by [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite), 
to my personal website on [saliei.io/jupyterlab](https://saliei.io/jupyterlab), that uses 
[Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly.
